We're very thankful to [Adrean Boyadzhiev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrean-boyadzhiev/) from [Lambda Bit](https://www.lambdabit.io/), who provided a security assessment and consultancy for Goiabada. Adrean's work focused on an earlier version (0.0.3), and while much has changed since, his insights were invaluable.

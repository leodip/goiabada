# Welcome to Goiabada

Goiabada is an open-source **OAuth2** and **OpenID Connect** server that makes user management simple and secure.

## What does Goiabada do?

If you're building applications and need to handle user logins, manage permissions, or enable users to sign in across multiple apps with one account, Goiabada takes care of this for you. Instead of building authentication from scratch, you can integrate Goiabada and focus on what makes your application unique.

Goiabada handles:

- **User authentication** - Secure login with passwords and two-factor authentication
- **Authorization** - Control who can access what in your applications
- **Single sign-on (SSO)** - Let users log in once and access multiple apps
- **API security** - Protect server-to-server communications
- **User self-service** - Give users control over their own profiles and security settings

## Who is Goiabada for?

- **Developers** building web or mobile apps who need authentication
- **Teams** wanting to centralize user management across multiple applications
- **Organizations** that need to self-host their identity provider for security or compliance

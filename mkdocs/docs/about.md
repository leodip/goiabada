# About
Goiabada was developed to be an easy-to-use container for user management. Plenty of alternatives exist, but this is my personal take on the concept.

I'm committed to make Goiabada forever free and open source. I want you to self host it and have total control over the code and data.

The name is inspired by a Brazilian sweet made with guava. I was keen on choosing a word that started with Go ðŸ˜‰

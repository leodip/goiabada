# About
I developed Goiabada with the aim of creating a user management container that blends simplicity with efficiency.

While plenty of alternatives exist, some paid, others open source, I felt it would be fun to create my own.

I'm committed to make Goiabada forever free and open source. You can self host it and have total control over the code and data.

The name is inspired by a Brazilian sweet made with guava. I was keen on choosing a word that started with Go ðŸ˜‰

Goiabada is an open-source **authentication** and **authorization** server. 

Goiabada makes user management easy for app developers. You can set up users, groups, resources, and permissions to integrate with your software. Plus, it handles authentication and authorization for server-to-server connections too.

- Built with Go for speed and low resource usage
- Easy-to-use interface
- Supports Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) with one-time passwords (OTP)
- Fine-tuned control over resources and permissions
- Self-service account page for users to update their details
- OAuth2 support, including authorization code flow and client credentials flow
- OpenID Connect support
- Compatible with MySQL and SQLite databases (other DBs coming soon)

### Important ⚠️

Goiabada is currently in **pre-release** stage. That means we may make significant changes in terms of feature scope and the structure of the application.

A new version is in the works where the admin console will be split out from the main auth server. Just keep in mind that, before the official first release, things may change.

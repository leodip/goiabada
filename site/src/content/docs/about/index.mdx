description: About Goiabada and its creator.

import { Aside, Card } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Goiabada was developed to be an easy-to-use solution for user management. Plenty of alternatives exist, but this is my personal take on the concept.

I'm committed to making Goiabada forever free and open source. I want you to self-host it and have total control over the code and data.

## The name

The name is inspired by a Brazilian sweet made with guava. I was keen on choosing a word that started with "Go" 😉

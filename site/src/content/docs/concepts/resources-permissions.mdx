title: Resources and permissions
description: Define fine-grained access control with resources and permissions.
---

In Goiabada, you can define both resources and permissions. Each resource can have multiple permissions associated with it.

You can assign these permissions to users, groups, or clients as needed.

## Scope format

When you pair a resource with a permission, it forms a **scope**, both in the authorization request and within the tokens.

**Format:** `resource-identifier:permission-identifier`

**Example:**

If you have:

- A resource with identifier: `product-api`
- A permission with identifier: `delete-product`

The resulting scope will be: `product-api:delete-product`

This scope can then be requested in authorization requests and will appear in access tokens, allowing fine-grained access control to your APIs and resources.

## System-level resource

The `authserver` resource is a **system-level resource** used internally by Goiabada. It has special protections:

- Its **resource identifier cannot be changed** (renaming is blocked)
- It **cannot be deleted**
- Its **description can be modified**
- New permissions **can be added** to it
- Its **built-in permission identifiers cannot be renamed or deleted**

The built-in permissions under the `authserver` resource are:

| Permission identifier | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|
| `userinfo` | Access to the `/userinfo` endpoint |
| `manage-account` | Self-service account management (Account API) |
| `manage` | Full admin access to all Admin API endpoints |
| `admin-read` | Read-only access to all Admin API endpoints |
| `manage-users` | Full access to user, group, and permission endpoints |
| `manage-clients` | Full access to client endpoints |
| `manage-settings` | Full access to settings and key endpoints |

You can create additional custom permissions on the `authserver` resource if needed, but the built-in ones listed above are protected.

## How to use scopes

1. **Define resources** - In the admin console, create resources that represent your APIs or protected areas (e.g., `product-api`, `user-service`)

2. **Create permissions** - For each resource, define the actions users or clients can perform (e.g., `read`, `write`, `delete`)

3. **Assign permissions** - Grant these permissions to:
   - Individual users
   - Groups (all members inherit the permissions)
   - Clients (for server-to-server access)

4. **Request scopes** - When initiating an authorization request, include the scopes your application needs:
   ```
   scope=openid product-api:read product-api:write
   ```

5. **Validate access** - In your API, check the access token for the required scopes before allowing access to resources

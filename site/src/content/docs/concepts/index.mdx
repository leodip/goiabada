import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Goiabada is useful in two main scenarios:

1. **Users accessing resources** - When users need access to specific resources (such as a section of your application or an API) and you want to manage that access.
2. **Server-to-server communications** - When servers need to access other servers, and you want to set defined permission levels for them.

## Users accessing resources

When you have users accessing resources, you need to know: who the user is (*authentication*), and whether they're authorized to access that resource (*authorization*).

Goiabada uses two familiar web protocols:
- **OpenID Connect** handles the who's who (*authentication*)
- **OAuth2** takes care of who can do what (*authorization*)

Regardless of your app type (a web app on the server side, a web app using JavaScript, or a mobile native app), the recommended approach is the **Authorization code flow with PKCE**.

The Authorization code flow with PKCE works in two steps:
1. The application requests an authorization code from the `/auth/authorize` endpoint
2. It exchanges this code for an access token, a refresh token, and optionally an ID token at the `/auth/token` endpoint

PKCE adds an extra layer of security by preventing interception of the authorization code, especially in public clients like mobile or single-page applications.

## Server-to-server communications

When you have a set of servers working together, and you want to ensure that only the right clients can access resources on a specific server, use the **Client credentials flow** with a confidential client.

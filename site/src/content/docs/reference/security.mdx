Security is a top priority for Goiabada. This page covers security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue, please report it via email to [contact@leodip.com](mailto:contact@leodip.com).

<Aside type="caution">
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Use the private email channel to allow time for a fix before public disclosure.

## Security assessment

We're very thankful to [Adrean Boyadzhiev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrean-boyadzhiev/) from [Lambda Bit](https://www.lambdabit.io/), who provided a security assessment and consultancy for Goiabada. Adrean's work focused on an earlier version (0.0.3), and while much has changed since, his insights were invaluable.

If you're looking for a security expert, we recommend reaching out to Adrean.

## Security features

Goiabada includes several built-in security features:

### Authentication security

- **PKCE required** - All authorization code flows require PKCE, protecting against code interception attacks
- **Two-factor authentication** - Optional or mandatory 2FA using TOTP
- **Rate limiting** - Configurable rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (login, OTP verification, password reset)
- **Session management** - Configurable session timeouts with idle and absolute expiration

### Token security

- **Short-lived access tokens** - Default 5-minute expiration to limit exposure
- **Refresh token rotation** - Each refresh token can only be used once
- **Signed JWTs** - All tokens are cryptographically signed

### Cookie security

- **Secure flag** - Cookies marked as secure in production (HTTPS only)
- **HttpOnly flag** - Cookies not accessible via JavaScript
- **SameSite attribute** - Protection against CSRF attacks

### Network security

- **CORS configuration** - Explicit web origin configuration required for JavaScript clients
- **Proxy header trust** - Must be explicitly enabled to prevent IP spoofing

## Production checklist

Before deploying to production, review the [production checklist](/production-deployment/production-checklist/) which covers:

- HTTPS configuration
- Secure cookie settings
- Session key generation
- Database security
- Network configuration

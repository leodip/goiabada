After starting Goiabada, here's what to do next.

## Log in to the admin console

Open the admin console URL in your browser:

- **Local testing**: http://localhost:9091
- **Production**: https://admin.yourdomain.com

Log in with the email and password you configured in your `docker-compose.yml` file (the `GOIABADA_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `GOIABADA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` values).

<Aside type="caution">
If you used the defaults (`admin@example.com` / `changeme`), change the password immediately after first login!

## OpenID Connect discovery

Goiabada exposes a standard OpenID Connect discovery endpoint at:

```
{auth-server-url}/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

For example: http://localhost:9090/.well-known/openid-configuration

This endpoint provides all the information OAuth/OIDC clients need to integrate with Goiabada.

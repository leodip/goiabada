import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="caution">
This setup uses HTTP without encryption and is suitable only for local testing. Don't use in production!
</Aside>

## Using the setup wizard (recommended)

The fastest way to get started:

```bash
# Download the setup wizard (Linux example)
curl -LO https://github.com/leodip/goiabada/releases/latest/download/goiabada-setup-linux-amd64
chmod +x goiabada-setup-linux-amd64

# Run the wizard
./goiabada-setup-linux-amd64
```

Select **"1. Local testing"** when prompted, choose your database, and the wizard generates a ready-to-use `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Access the admin console at: http://localhost:9091

## Verify it's working

```bash
# Check containers are running
docker ps | grep goiabada

# Test auth server health (should return: healthy)
curl http://localhost:9090/health && echo

# Test admin console health (should return: healthy)
curl http://localhost:9091/health && echo
```

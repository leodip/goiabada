Goiabada was developed in [Go](https://go.dev/) using Linux. The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/leodip/goiabada) includes a VS Code dev container with all dependencies pre-configured.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install [Microsoft's Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Open the repository in the dev container
4. Run `make serve` from the `src/authserver` directory
5. Run `make serve` from the `src/adminconsole` directory (in another terminal)

You now have a running Goiabada instance.

│   ├── cmd/           # Entry point
│   ├── internal/      # Internal packages
│   ├── tests/         # Integration tests
│   └── web/           # Templates and static files

├── core/               # Shared code between applications
└── build/              # Docker and build scripts
```

## Make commands

Each module has its own Makefile with standard targets:

```bash
# Development server with hot reload (requires Air)
make serve

# Build the binary
make build

# Run tests against a running server
make test-local

# Static analysis and linting
make check
```

## Running tests

For integration tests:

1. Start the auth server: `make serve` in `src/authserver`
2. In another terminal, run: `make test-local` in `src/authserver`

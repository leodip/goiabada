Goiabada was developed in [Go](https://go.dev/) using Linux. The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/leodip/goiabada) includes a VS Code dev container with all dependencies pre-configured.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install [Microsoft's Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Open the repository in the dev container
4. Run `make serve` from the `src/authserver` directory
5. Run `make serve` from the `src/adminconsole` directory (in another terminal)

You now have a running Goiabada instance accessible at:

- **Auth server**: http://localhost:19090
- **Admin console**: http://localhost:19091

Default credentials:

- **Email**: admin@example.com
- **Password**: changeme

## AI-assisted development

The repository includes a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root with detailed architecture documentation, authentication flow state machines, OAuth2 implementation details, and coding patterns. This file is designed to help AI coding assistants (like Claude, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot) understand the codebase quickly.

```


## Running tests

To run the complete test suite (100% of tests):

```bash
cd src/authserver
./run-tests.sh
```

This script will:
- Run unit tests for authserver, adminconsole, and core modules
- Run data layer tests against all supported databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite)
- Run integration tests against all supported databases
- Automatically handle server startup/shutdown and cleanup
